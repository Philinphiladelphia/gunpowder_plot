# Gadget-Building Tabs:

## Walls

All walls are approved. Remember: we can use the entire Powder Toy frame as a throwable spell. When it collides with a different frame, they will merge and interpolate. This allows us to have static things like walls be part of a dynamic spell.

## Electronics

All electronics are permitted. I can't figure this shit out myself, but I'm pretty sure that my AI can.

## Powered Materials

Ditto electronics. However, remove both of these if the AI starts getting confused.

## Sensors

Ditto the two above.

## Force

Ditto the three above.

Ahh, explosives. A wonderful category. 

Standouts:

Lightning. This element is fucking PERFECT.
