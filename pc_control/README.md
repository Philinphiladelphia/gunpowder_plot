Player Character (PC) control is the name of the control scheme shared by both the player character and the Demon King.

This control scheme consists of the following elements:

## Basics

Omnidirectional movement, controlled by either a joystick or WASD. Movement is the same speed in all directions.

Left hand button. You can hold a spell or item in this hand.

Right hand button. You can hold a spell or item in this hand.

A roll button. This roll can be replaced with various magical effects with similar power and range of effect, as determined by the DM.

## Speaking

A "speak" button. Once the player gains mana, this is changed to "toggle magic".

The speak button operates on this gui element:
A wheel consisting of 8 spells. Demonic artefacts are a special class of spell which grants the user permanent mana on kills. Defensive items and one-time things like grenades or potions also exist.

When the "speak/toggle magic" button is pressed, the player gains access to a keyboard input or voice control briefly. They input their magical phrase, then the DM interprets its effects. Castable spells are cast and then saved to a slot. Movement-based spells are saved in the roll slot. Persona spells are saved in the Persona spell slot. Verbal commands are enforced on nearby NPCs.

While magic is toggled on, the PC will project a "gunpowder zone". This gunpowder zone allows magic to manifest inside of it. Just activating the gunpowder zone draws some mana, so players cannot keep it active permantantly. Pressing the "toggle magic" button again deactivates your gunpowder zone.

## Advanced Magic

Three advanced magical buttons: Charge Spell, Combine Spell and Remove Spell.

Charge Spell is activated by holding the spell button. All spells are chargable. Spells can be cast instantly, but this will not grant their full effects.

Combine Spell is activated by pressing speak, creating a spell, then pressing speak again. You will specify a space on the wheel. The DM will combine the spell you've spoken with the one in the slot to give you a more powerful, combined spell.

Remove Spell is activated by pressing speak, then pressing one of the face buttons. You select a spell from one of your slots. Once you press the face button three times in a row, the spell is broken and destroyed forever.
