Licensing:

I don't need to apply the GPL3 license to my code because I'm not modifying the Powder Toy. I'm downloading it, running it as a server, then interacting with it via a LUA API. I never touch it, I don't need to bundle it with my code base. It's an independent install.

Llama (or whatever other model people wanna select) works the same way. It has its owm licensing restrictions, but I can get around them by making Llama downloadable later instead of packaging it with the game.

If I take these two steps I'll have no licensing requirements at all. I'm totally free to privatize, monetize and own my work.

And if they ask me to open-source it later? Done.
