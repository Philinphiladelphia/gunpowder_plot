I need to gather a bunch of visual examples of what I want my game to look like. Old pixel are, complex cityscapes, etc. This is the time to draw HEAVILY upon my inspirations for images.

The most important part of AI-generated art is the prompt. A reference image can and should be generated, then provided with every prompt. However, the prompt engineering is gonna of paramount importance here. It will determine one unique visual style for my game.

I don't have the time nor shits to give to actually integrate generative AI into this game. I'm going to determine a small subset of art styles that I like, then generate thousands of different item and skill icons, saving them along with the prompts that made them. The AI can use a search functionality to locate the most similar item or skill icon.

Environment building blocks will need to be given by example. I'll design the building blocks of the world by hand, then make them into a template. I'll ask the bot to slightly extend and update that template to make a variety of environments. Each environmental set will be saved into it's own template, then will be selected randomly. Maybe selected by DM?

I'll also want to use the pixel art generator to make all of my animations for moving parts. Complex buildings or premade structures will need many different sprites built up into one scene, I need to make all the parts.

Monster sprites and NPC sprites will require very special attention so that they look good and animate. That's all gonna be manual. Maybe the AI could generate me a nice cut-up 128x128 animation sheet for each monster? Would make my life easy. I'll have to design the layout.






I think it's not that deep. I just specify a list of actions, duration for each action, and the corresponding number of frames for each duration. Boom, animation system. Done.

After that, I should specify viewpoint (top-down), artistic style (impressionistic realism with dark tones, as if seeing the real world through the dark lens of a nightmare.)

I can specify attributes of the animations (make sure that they have a feeling of momentum by varying the amount of movement from frame to frame.) I especially want attacks to have a feeling of "starting small" and then "releasing explosively". Some attacks could have the feelings of "relentless onslaught" or "rapier accuracy" or any one of a number of other things. Movement abilities should have the feelings of "precise control" and "instant acceleration". Defensive abilities should have the feelings of "inner light" or "self-corruption", possibly combined.

Persona spells should have the feelings of "cosmic mystery", "ultimate power", "infinite complexity" and "reality-twisting chaos".


PCs will have their own special layout.
