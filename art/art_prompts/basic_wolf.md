I'm gonna cut all enemy types that are not exactly the same as the NPC/Demon King with a recolor or maybe a couple small items. Keep the art set very very small, because it's a weakness of mine.



Pixel art is not a great idea. I would do better generatively. I want to make a Noita-like magical animation system with manipulable rules. Everything should be particulate-based. I think I'm gonna have to go study the Noita magic system. What I'm making is top-down Noita with an AI butler to make your spells for you. Their particulate magic system is perfect for me. Go read up.




I think it's not that deep. I just specify a list of actions, duration for each action, and the corresponding number of frames for each duration. Boom, animation system. Done.

After that, I should specify viewpoint (top-down), artistic style (impressionistic realism with dark tones, as if seeing the real world through the dark lens of a nightmare.)

I can specify attributes of the animations (make sure that they have a feeling of momentum by varying the amount of movement from frame to frame.) I especially want attacks to have a feeling of "starting small" and then "releasing explosively". Some attacks could have the feelings of "relentless onslaught" or "rapier accuracy" or any one of a number of other things. Movement abilities should have the feelings of "precise control" and "instant acceleration". Defensive abilities should have the feelings of "inner light" or "self-corruption", possibly combined.

Persona spells should have the feelings of "cosmic mystery", "ultimate power", "infinite complexity" and "reality-twisting chaos".


PCs will have their own special layout.



Please provide me an animation sheet for a wolf enemy. This wolf has been overtaken by dark magic and has been made more powerful and bloodthirsty.

The animation sheet should contain ten frames of the wolf performing a lunging bite attack.

Turn to a given rotation.

Move forwards.

Static overwatch, searching for enemies.

Dynamic overwatch, moving forwards while searching for enemies.

Basic attack.

Heavy attack.

Death.

Forwards dash.


This did not work at all. Generative models are stupid as hell.
